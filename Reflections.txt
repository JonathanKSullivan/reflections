	Reflect: Using History for Efficiency
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
		you can have multiple temporal access points in which to manipulate the file. lets say that a particular change on a website
		was not what thee client wanted but everything prior to that meeting was fine. You could easily retreive and old version and 
		implement the correct solution.
	
	Reflect: Manual Commits
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
		Pro is the the bersions are much more meaningful and readible to humans however the con is that humans are prone to error
		and emotion. If the deadline for a product is in 12 hours and we've found significant bugs, the our emotion may lead us
		to use bad practices due to stress.
	Reflect: Multi-File Commits
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs,
treat each file separately?
		Programs are usually multi file projects with interconeted computation logic. Documents are not.

	Reflect: Using Git to View History
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
		you must first cd in to the repository. the git log will show you a chronologivcal history of all the previous commits
		starting with the most recent. git diff allows yyou to compare any 2 commits by using the 2 commit ids.
		
	Reflect: Confidence from Version Control
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
		because you can always revert back to a working copy.
		
		
	Reflect: How Do You Want to Use Git?
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
		To built my githubu profile and git a job.(pun intended.)
